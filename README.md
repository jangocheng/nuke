# About NUKE

Founded in April 2017, NUKE is a free, open-source build automation system for C#/.NET that runs cross-platform on .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Mono. While builds are bootstrapped with conventional Bash or PowerShell scripts, their actual implementation resides in simple [C# console applications](http://www.nuke.build/docs/authoring-builds/fundamentals.html). This approach unleashes the power of the type system and natively provides IDE features like code-completion, refactorings, and debugging. A custom [global tool](http://www.nuke.build/docs/running-builds/global-tool.html) and several [IDE extensions](http://www.nuke.build/docs/running-builds/from-ides.html) further improve how build projects are setup, authored and executed.
